# Augmentation-web-app-library

Side project #1 - 2021

The project was build to demonstrate what is augmentation in Machine learning. For this we have used the concept of 
augmentation based on rotation to generate a no of images.

## Issues

- Currently the application does not display output images
- Show other augmentation techniques, maybe use side bar concept in `st.sidebar.selectbox`
